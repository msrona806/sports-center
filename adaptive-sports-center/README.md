# Adaptive Sports Center

## About 

Adaptive Sports Center offers a centralized location for adaptive sports competitions, trainings, camps, and events to be shared.  Finding opportunities for disability friendly events can be a daunting task. Adaptive Sports Center aims to help those wanting to engage in activities an easy way to find and share events.

This app was created using Mysql, Express, React, and Node. Events are listed from third-party sites using axios and cheerio, then stored in a mysql database. Visitors to the site have the ability to send a request for events to be added directly to the site. Nodemailer is utilized to send emails from the app to the app adminstrator for review.

## Starting the app locally

Start by installing front and backend dependencies. While in this directory, run the following commands:

```
yarn install
cd client
yarn install
cd ..
``

After both installations complete, run the following command in your terminal:

```
yarn start


That's it, your app should be running on <http://localhost:3000>. The Express server should intercept any AJAX requests from the client.
